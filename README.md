# Accuracy and Power Analysis of Interaction Networks

This repository contains code to compute the correlation between an estimated social network and the true, unobserved social network for networks constructed from interaction rates. Simulations are also included to verify the method. This repository also contains code to compute power analyses on interaction networks.
